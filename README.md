# useful_scripts
# get_amazon_review.py is a python script that I used to help my girlfriend to grab reviews from amazon (she need to know the number of review for a certain product each year). You just need to change the URL and the variable year. It will automatically get webpages from amazon and parse the html and extract the information that you want.
